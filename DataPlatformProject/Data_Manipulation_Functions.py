        Applies a user-defined transformation function to specified columns in a DataFrame.

        WHAT IT IS:
            A generic function that lets you apply an arbitrary operation to each data point
            or entire Series of the chosen columns.

        WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR:
            - Converting voltage to current (I = V / R).
            - Normalizing/scaling data, applying log transforms, etc.
            - Quickly prototyping domain-specific calculations on your dataset.

        CAVEATS:
            - Your transform function must be compatible with the data type in the chosen columns.
            - If new_column_name is provided but multiple columns are selected, the same transform 
              is stored in the single new column (not typical). 
            - If large DataFrames are used, be mindful of performance.

        PARAMETERS:
            df : pd.DataFrame
                The original DataFrame containing your data.
            columns : list
                The columns you want to transform.
            transform_func : callable
                The function or lambda to be applied.
            new_column_name : str, optional
                If provided, the transformed values are assigned to this new column 
                (for single-column transforms).
            inplace : bool, default False
                If True, modifies df directly. Otherwise returns a copy.

        Exports the DataFrame to a CSV file.

        WHAT IT IS:
            Saves the data to a comma-separated-values file, a plain-text format widely used for data interchange.

        WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR:
            - Quick, lightweight exporting of tabular data.
            - Easy interoperability with spreadsheets and other data-analysis tools.

        CAVEATS:
            - Does not preserve types as explicitly as binary formats.
            - Large CSVs may be slow to handle and large on disk.

        Exports the DataFrame to an Excel file.

        WHAT IT IS:
            Saves data in a native spreadsheet format (.xlsx), preserving tabular structure,
            columns, and (optionally) data types.

        WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR:
            - Interoperability with Excel for further analysis or sharing.
            - Maintaining multiple sheets in a single file if needed (e.g., using ExcelWriter).

        CAVEATS:
            - Requires the openpyxl or xlsxwriter libraries installed for .xlsx files.
            - Excel files can be larger in size than CSVs, and saving can be slower.

        Exports the DataFrame to a text file.

        WHAT IT IS:

        WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR:
            - Sharing data in a very human-readable or simple format.
            - Easy to parse with custom scripts if CSV or Excel are not desired.

        CAVEATS:
            - No built-in type preservation (all data becomes text).
            - Potentially large file sizes for big datasets.

        Exports the DataFrame to a JSON file.

        WHAT IT IS:
            Saves data in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

        WHAT IT'S GOOD FOR:
            - Interoperability with web services and modern APIs.
            - Flexible structure for nested or hierarchical data.

        CAVEATS:
            - Not as compact as binary formats for large data.
            - JSON structure can become confusing if you pick an orient that doesnâ€™t suit your use case.
